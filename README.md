# DropIns-Registration-System

Drop-in Games Registration App is a scalable, cloud-based web application designed to streamline the registration and management of drop-in sports games for schools and community centers. The system replaces manual and error-prone registration methods with a secure, automated platform that enables real-time capacity tracking, fair participant sign-ups, and role-based access for students, organizers, and administrators. Built using a hybrid AWS architecture combining serverless services and traditional components, the application ensures high availability, security, and cost efficiency while supporting features such as authentication, live data updates, duplicate prevention, and administrative game management.
